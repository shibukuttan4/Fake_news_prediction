## About The Project

[![Model Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-95%25-brightgreen)](https://github.com/shibukuttan4/Fake_news_prediction)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

This project is a Fake News Prediction system built using Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing. It can determine whether a news article is real or fake based on its content. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and achieves an accuracy of 95%.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and use the model.

---

## Usage

You can use this project to predict the authenticity of news articles. Provide the article content as input, and the model will classify it as real or fake. Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
# Example code for using the model
from fake_news_predictor import FakeNewsPredictor

predictor = FakeNewsPredictor()
article_content = "This is a sample news article..."
prediction = predictor.predict(article_content)
print(f"Prediction: {'Real' if prediction == 0 else 'Fake'}")
```
